This reprositary is filled with files originally intented for use in a my bachelor thesis, where I evaluated 3-dimensional protein and chemical data.
This data was previously used to train and validate the AI model Diffdock.
In hindsight many things could have been improved upon, most importantly file formats could have been more standardized, and the graphing could have been made in jupiter Notebook
Pull_out_names.py doesn't work on here because I could not upload the data used in it to github due to size limitasions.
This code was originally only intented for my own use, and only intended for my own reading, so it may be difficult to read for others.
